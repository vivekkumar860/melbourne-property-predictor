# Melbourne Property Price Prediction - Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview
The Melbourne Property Price Prediction application is a comprehensive Streamlit-based web application designed to accurately predict property prices in Melbourne, Australia. The project combines traditional machine learning with advanced computer vision and geospatial analysis to provide users with data-driven property valuations and insights.

## 2. Dataset Description
- **Source**: Melbourne housing market dataset
- **Size**: 12,968 properties
- **Price Range**: $85,000 - $2,350,000
- **Average Price**: $982,626
- **Features**: Property type, rooms, bathrooms, car spaces, land size, building area, location (suburb), year built, etc.

## 3. Core Machine Learning Implementation

### 3.1 Data Preprocessing
- Loading and cleaning of the Melbourne housing dataset
- Handling of missing values using appropriate imputation techniques
- Feature engineering to create new valuable predictors
- Encoding of categorical variables (OneHotEncoding for property types and suburbs)

### 3.2 Model Development
- Implementation of a Random Forest Regressor as the primary prediction model
- Hyperparameter tuning through cross-validation
- Feature importance analysis to understand key price drivers
- Ensemble modeling approach to improve prediction accuracy
- Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics

### 3.3 Prediction Pipeline
- Data validation and preprocessing of user inputs
- Model inference to generate property price predictions
- Confidence interval generation (±10%)
- Price breakdown into land value and building value components
- Adjustment of predictions based on visual features (if images provided)
